Experienced Software Engineer with 8 years of experience in backend and distributed systems, including 5 years building and launching a greenfield storage product (S3 Express) at AWS. I spend my time solving distributed systems problems with a focus on performance, scalability, and correctness. I’m known for driving projects from design to delivery, collaborating across teams, and helping grow engineering teams through mentorship and technical leadership.

Outside of work, I’m an avid mountain biker and skier aiming to take full advantage of what the pacific northwest has on offer. Before my software career, I worked as a sailing instructor.
